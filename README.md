# For Phantom:
\- If plate is going to be case top, get plate from Swillâ€™s tool.  
\- If using 1.5mm metalic plate with acrylic case, use Phantom plate spacer and at least one bezel layer (Layer F)

##### Sample Thickness:
A - Any 1mm+. Feet Spacer must be at least 3mm (This is to accomodate the Teensy 2.0)  
B - Any 1mm+  
C + D - 8mm or 9mm. Use layer C for bottom side as it has notch for USB plug, if you use one one layer, then use layer C.  
E - 3
# For QFR/Filco:
\- Due to the controller being on the top side of the PCB, QFR/Filco requires a plate spacer AND a controller spacer as well QFR/Filco has to have at least one layer of the bezel to cover the controller daughter board

##### Sample Thickness:
A - Any 1mm+. Feet Spacer is not required  
B - Any 1mm+  
C + D - 5mm or 6mm. Use layer C for bottom side as it has notch for USB plug, if you use one one layer, then use layer C.  
E - 5mm  
F - 5mm  
G - Any 1mm+  

\- Use bezel layer depending on your preferred layout  
\- To make the plate layer, make your layout on http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ and then generate plate using http://builder.swillkb.com/. Then open the file in a vector editor and lign up the contants using the + mark on the esc position on the plate layer.  
\- FEET BOT is only required if you want to have a perfectly flat keyboard.  
\- Ask your laser cutter to first cut lines in red, then blue and finally black. This should minimise errors due to acrylic warp.  

##### Assembly requires:
\- 13x 10mm M3 Standoffs  
\- 2x M3 Standoffs are required for tilting feet. Usually 8-10mm would do.  
\- 17x 5mm M3 Flathead screws  
\- 13x M3 Flathead screws. Length should be between (Total thickness - 7)mm to (Total thickness - 12)mm

#For GON
\- ONLY MOUNTING PLATE HAS BEEN ADDED CURRENTLY
\- This is just a mockup made by superimposing the PCB over the standard TKL Laout and shiffting the the Fn row to required distence
